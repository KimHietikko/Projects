#InstagramFollowersFollowings 
This is my own project made by Java language. In this program you can find out does someone who you follow, follow you back. The program uses Jsoup library by parsing different information.
First the program asks the user's Instagram username then inputs it to GalleryOfSocial website where you can check your followers and followings.
The downsides are that the profile needs to be public and it doesn't work with lots of followers/followings
One solution might be that this program would use Instagram API and then check the followers and followings by using it.
