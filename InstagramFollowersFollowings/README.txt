#InstagramFollowersFollowings 
a program where you can find out does someone who you follow, follow you back. The program uses Jsoup library by parsing different information.
First the program parses the user's ID from the Instagram page then inputs the ID to pictame website where you can check your follower and followings.
The downsides are that the profile needs to be public and you can only have around 200 followers/followings because pictame shows only that much in one page.
Pictame follower/following pages don't go in any logic order so it's hard to check rest of the pages.
One solution might be that this program requires Instagram API and then check the followers and followings by using it.
