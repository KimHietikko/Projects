In this reposity there are my courses' practical works and my own projects.

#Elokuvat_projekti 
This is a practical work for university's programming course. 
The program is written in Java language and the front end is made by SceneBuilder (University's own software).
In this program you can add your own movies and add information for them (name, rating, when it's made, genre and who has directed it). 
You can also add actors to a certain movie. You can search movies by their information (name, rating etc.).
There is also a option to delete a movie and/or an actor.
Bonus feature is a button which randomly suggest a movie to watch.

#InstagramFollowersFollowings 
This is my own project made by Java language. This is a program where you can find out does someone who you follow, follow you back. The program uses Jsoup library by parsing different information.
First the program parses the user's ID from the Instagram page then inputs the ID to pictame website where you can check your follower and followings.
The downsides are that the profile needs to be public and you can only have around 200 followers/followings because pictame shows only that much in one page.
Pictame follower/following pages don't go in any logic order so it's hard to check rest of the pages.
One solution might be that this program requires Instagram API and then check the followers and followings by using it.

#KanjiCollector 
This is my own project made by Java language. This is a program which uses Jsoup to parse different information from memrise (studying page). 
This program is used to parse Japanese kanjis, pronunciations and their english meanings.
The infomation is printed and then it can be copy-pasted into, for example Microsoft Excel where the information can be divided into their own cells.
I have used this program to make course materials for Japanese courses. I have made excel and pdf files from this information and then the teacher has been shared it with other students.
