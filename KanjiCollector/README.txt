#KanjiCollector 
is a program which uses Jsoup to parse different information from memrise (studying page). 
This program is used to parse Japanese kanjis, pronunciations and their english meanings.
The infomation is printed and then it can be copy-pasted into, for example Microsoft Excel where the information can be divided into their own cells.
I have used this program to make course materials for Japanese courses. I have made excel and pdf files from this information and then the teacher has been shared it with other students.
